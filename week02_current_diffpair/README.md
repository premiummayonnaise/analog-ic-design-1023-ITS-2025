# **Welcome to Week 2 of the course!**

During the second week, the course will be mainly focusing on the **implementations of current mirrors**, including their different configurations. 

---

For the assignments of this week, the focus is on the **current mirrors characteristics** and key parameters such as:

- **W/L ratio**
- **Biasing techniques**
- **Vsupply sweep**
- **Channel length modulation**

> All of the parameters above will affect the value of the output current.

---

After that, there will be a little glimpse on **differential pairs**, which is also another crucial block in analog IC design.
